# GitChat
*Real-time chat, built with Blazor WebAssembly*

Planned functionality includes Git integration with chat application, allowing things such as linking work items, alerting on new pull requests or pipeline failures, etc.

Right now the main goal is to create a working chat application, with Git integration being a final destination of the project

## For contributions

Each feature and new functionality should have an issue associated with it, mentioning feature description and implementation details - use tags to easily distinguish between different issue categories

Each pull request should have an Issue associated with it, so that completing Pull request automatically solves an issue

Branching and naming strategies are described in Wiki and should be followed
